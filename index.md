<p style="text-align: center;">I studied Game Design and Development at the National Film and Television School. I enjoy programming Systems, AI and general Gameplay, as seen in my projects like Evil Incremental, Herd'Em and Project Train. I equally enjoy making shaders, both image effect and object shaders. The results of my shaders can be seen in Sirenum (Image Effect) and Project Train (Image Effect and Objects) where I did some VFX work. </p> </br> 
<p style="text-align: center;"> I am proficient in several programming languages and am very comfortable with C#, Python and HLSL. In my own time I develop smaller games - I am currently continuing development of Evil Incremental for a full release while making a game for the Playdate.</p>

Sirenum is a first person narrative game created in 1 month. It is made in Unity. 
I programmed and designed all core systems, as well as the dithered outline post processing shader.

### Challenges

<ul>
  <li>Branching narrative.</li>
  <li>Real time game progression. From start to finish, the game will take a maximum of around 10 minutes. The story progresses regardless of player action.</li>
  <li>Heavy dialogue usage requiring a custom dialogue queuer.</li>
</ul>

### Tools

Unity 3D, C#, Unity Audio, CG language for Unity post processing and object shaders

Evil Incremental is an active incremental puzzler in the vein of Orb of Creation.
Made in Unity and targeted at the Android Platform.
I programmed and designed the entire experience. Most of the UI is also made by me, except for the icons.

### Challenges

<ul>
  <li>Extensive understanding of Unity UI for various screen sizes.</li>
  <li>Coding a solid save system.</li>
</ul>

### Tools and Skills

Unity 2D for Mobile, C#, Unity Audio, Mechanics Design and Balancing, [Machinations](https://machinations.io)

Herd'Em is a Couch Co-op Herding game that is played by one or two players. The players each control one dog or one player controls both. They must herd the sheep into the neighbouring enclosure. Made in Unity. 

### Challenges

<ul>
  <li>Coding a solid Herding algorithm with low performance cost amortized across frames. Each sheep's movement is updated each tick, which can be tweaked according to performance needs.</li>
  <li> Fully remappable user input since the game is played by two players on one keyboard.</li>
</ul>

### Tools

Unity 3D, C#, Unity Audio

  <li>Player movement on dynamic objects.</li>
</ul>

### Tools

Unity 3D, C#, Unity Audio, Maya
