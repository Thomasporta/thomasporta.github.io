### Summary
Evil Incremental is an active incremental puzzler where you play as a recently reawakened evil god whose purpose is to destroy the world. 
**It has now been played by 10000+ players.**

Spawn spirits that generate various resources. Accumulate those resources to buy upgrades, unlock new spirits and progress in the story. Use the day night cycle to your advantage to become stronger. 

Will you annihilate the world?

### Role
I programmed and designed the entire experience. Most of the UI is also made by me, except for the icons. I used [Machinations](https://machinations.io) and Excel to balance the numbers. I am still working on this game in my own time and aim to add more content, refine and create mechanics and add leaderboards to encourage speedrunning and replayability.

### Challenges

<ul>
  <li>Extensive understanding of Unity UI for various screen sizes.</li>
  <li>Coding a solid save system and future proof save system.</li>
  <li>Creating a WebGL build of the game for web users.</li>
</ul>

### Learning Outcomes

<ul>
  <li>Proficiency in various Unity UI systems that enable scaling across target devices.</li>
  <li>Understanding of WebGL pipeline for games built on Unity.</li>
  <li>Making strong mechanics that are easily maintainable and can accomodate future updates without making past save files outdated. I had to update the game post launch several times.</li>
  <li>Understanding of Binary Serialization and reading/writing binary for saving games.</li>
</ul>

### Tools and Software

### Comments from players on Itch.io

*"This is one of the better incremental games I've played. Fun theme, upgrade decisions that matter, an end goal, and no rebirth mechanics to pad out the experience."* - Homicidal_Harry

*"Really strong theme! The sound design is great with whistling wind and somber music, and the monster sounds you get with the chapter text is great."* - An Actual Typhon
