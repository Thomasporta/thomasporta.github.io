### Summary
Evil Incremental is an active incremental puzzler where you play as a recently reawakened evil god whose purpose is to destroy the world. 

Spawn spirits that generate various resources. Accumulate those resources to buy upgrades, unlock new spirits and progress in the story. Use the day night cycle to your advantage to become stronger. 

Will you annihilate the world?

### Role
I programmed and designed the entire experience. Most of the UI is also made by me, except for the icons. I used [Machinations](https://machinations.io)and Excel to balance the numbers. I am still working on this game on my own time and aim to add more content, refine and create mechanics and add leaderboards to encourage speedrunning and replayability.

### Comments from players

*This is one of the better incremental games I've played. Fun theme, upgrade decisions that matter, an end goal, and no rebirth mechanics to pad out the experience.*

*Really strong theme! The sound design is great with whistling wind and somber music, and the monster sounds you get with the chapter text is great.*
