### Summary

Project Train is a retro FPS where you control a death train. The train has four shurikens that you can activate to kill demons that have
infested the valley. This prototype consists of one level.

### Role 

I was programmer and a technical artist for this game. I coded the train and its behaviour as well logic for core systems. My Collaborator, Nick McKenzie, and I both coded 
enemy AI and sensory systems for these AI agents. I also was in charge of creating the retro look -a post processing effect and an old school 
texturing style coupled with low polygon models. I was in charge of creating the VFX such as blood splatters and AI shooting.
