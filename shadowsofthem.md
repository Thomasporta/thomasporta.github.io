### Summary

Shadows of them is a first-person psychological horror game where the player must navigate a series of challenges, guiding a mother through her grief after the loss of her family. The game takes place in a metro station where the character is stuck in a seemingly endless loop as she struggles to cope with her grief. Shadows of Them was a Develop Indie Showcase finalist.

### Role

I programmed core systems like loop transitions and game logic. I was the lighting artist for the game as well as the level designer. You can download my level design drawings [here](/assets/img/LoopMapsCombined.pdf).
