title: About me
subtitle: Programmer and Technical Artist
---

I am Thomas Porta, a programmer and technical artist. I studied Game Development at the National Film and Television school.
Previously I was a Machine Learning Scientist. I also have a MSc in Machine Learning from UCL and a BSc in Physics from McGill University. It's fair to say I like Science and Engineering.

### Skills

I work really well as part of a team and enjoy exchanging ideas with peers and friends. I am not scared to cut large parts of my work if this helps make the game more focused. I live by the sentence, "Ideas are cheap and plentiful". I manage my time well and always deliver things on time. I am driven and always have an eye on the goal and the bigger picture.  

I am familiar with these engines and platforms,

<ul>
  <li>Unity (URP and Built-in RP)</li>
  <li>Unreal Engine</li>
  <li>Playdate SDK</li>
</ul>

I am proficient in these coding languages,

<ul>
  <li>C#</li>
  <li>HLSL and CG (for shaders in Unity)</li>
  <li>Lua</li>
  <li>Python</li>
</ul>

I have experience coding gameplay mechanics and systems for games. I also code shaders in HLSL/CG and am comfortable using shader graphs. 
I can do both post processing and standard per-object shaders. 

### Software 

Unity, Unreal, Maya, Photoshop

### Favourite Games

I play a wide variety of games. I enjoy both competitive and non competitive games, but if I had to pick a few foundational games I'd pick the following, 

<ul>
  <li> <strong>Dishonored </strong> and more widely anything Arkane has made for putting the player first.</li>
  <li> <strong>Alien Isolation</strong> because of its fun AI and its incredible atmosphere.</li>
  <li> <strong>Bloodborne</strong> for its perfect systems.</li>
  <li> <strong>Skyrim</strong> for its cozy atmosphere. And a special thanks to all the modders who passionately support it expecting no monetary reward.</li>
  <li> <strong>Monument Valley</strong> for the snippets of peace each level has given me.</li>
  <li> <strong>Control</strong> for its faithfulness to Brutalist architecture and attention to technical details.</li>
  <li> <strong>Sable</strong>, a cozy world where you can take your time.</li>
</ul>

### Hobbies
I like running, football and taking pictures of buildings. You can find some of my pictures [here](https://thomasporta.github.io/photography).
