I am Thomas Porta, a programmer and technical artist. I studied Game Development at the National Film and television school.
Before that I was a Machine Learning Scientist (I have a MSc in Machine Learning from UCL).

### Skills

I am familiar with these engines and platforms,

<ul>
  <li>Unity (URP and Built-in RP)</li>
  <li>Unreal Engine</li>
  <li>Playdate SDK</li>
</ul>

I am proficient in these coding languages,

<ul>
  <li>C#</li>
  <li>HLSL and CG (for shaders in Unity)</li>

</ul>

I have experience coding gameplay mechanics and systems for games. I also code shaders in HLSL/CG and am comfortable using shader graphs. 
I can do both post processing and standard per-object shaders.
