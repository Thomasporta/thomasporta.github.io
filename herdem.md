### Summary

Herd'Em is a cozy puzzler where you control herding dogs. You are tasked with guiding the sheep towards the neighbouring enclosure. Each dog is controlled by its own keybinds so you can play with someone else or by yourself!

### Role

I programmed the herding behaviour using Boid algorithm with some modified components to account for fences and dogs. For performance reasons the sheep behaviour is executed at set intervals which can be modified according to needs.
