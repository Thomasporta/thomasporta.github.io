### Summary
Sirenum is a monochromatic game taking place on the Pope, a ship that has been lost in space for more than a year. You and your sick companion, Lev, fly by what seems to be another dead planet. Or is it?  You receive a transmission from this planet inviting you to land. Lev is not himself and becomes charmed, will you?

### Role
I programmed and designed all core systems, as well as the dithered outline post processing shader. The outline effect uses Discontinuity based methods for outlining. In this instance only the color discontinuity is used since I hand color faces of objects using vertex colors. All objects in the game are modelled by me.
